    "Created a set of example reports via ChatGPT with the following prompt: \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you generate Python code to create a data frame containing the text of 20 radiology reports from brain CT such as the provided example? Make 10 of the reports traumatic brain injury (some of which have post-traumatic hemorrhage, and the rest have no hemorrhage or other remarkable findings). For the other 10 reports, describe non-traumatic brain injury patients with or without alternative neurological diagnoses. Each report should include 5-10 sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example report:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> History: Trauma from a motor vehicle accident. CT Head: Reveals a large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (4.5 x 3.8 x 4.2 cm) with surrounding vasogenic edema and an 8 mm midline shift towards the left. Multiple smaller petechial hemorrhages consistent with diffuse axonal injury are noted, along with mild compression of the right lateral ventricle. A small subarachnoid hemorrhage and epidural hematoma are present, with a non-displaced right frontal bone fracture extending into the frontal sinus. Impression: Severe traumatic brain injury with significant mass effect and midline shift, requiring close neurological monitoring and possible neurosurgical intervention.\n",
